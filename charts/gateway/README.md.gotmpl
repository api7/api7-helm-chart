## API7 Gateway for Kubernetes

API7 Gateway is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway.

API7 Gateway provides rich traffic management features such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, canary release, circuit breaking, authentication, observability, and more.

You can use API7 Gateway to handle traditional north-south traffic, as well as east-west traffic between services.
