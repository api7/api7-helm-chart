Helm Chart for API7-Dashboard
==============================

This is the helm chart for [api7-dashboard](https://github.com/api7/api7-dashboard).

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you go ahead, please make sure that you have installed [helm](https://helm.sh) in the environment that you'll operate the Kubernetes cluster.

Next, since we don't have a private online repository for these enterprise-edition projects, you should clone/downlod this project to that environment.

Quick Start
-----------

```sh
cd /path/to/api7-helm-chart/charts/api7-dashboard
helm dependency update .
```

Images for api7-dashboard is private and never should be uploaded to public image registries like [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com), so make sure the image for api7-dashboard was stashed in a registry that can be accessed from the Kubernetes cluster.

```sh
helm install api7-dashboard . -n api7 \
  --set image.repository=api7-dashboard \
  --set service.type=NodePort \
  --set image.tag=2.8.2206 \
  --post-renderer /path/to/api7-helm-chart/charts/api7-dashboard/kustomize/kustomize \
  --create-namespace
```

When you execute the above command, change the registry, repository and tag according to your situation.

Checking the running status of api7-dashboard.

```sh
kubectl get deploy,service -n api7

By default it also installed Prometheus components.


Cleanup
-------

```sh
helm uninstall api7-dashboard -n api7
```

Customization
-------------

See [values.yaml](./values.yaml) to learn all the config items. Here the most common scenarios will be illustrated.

### How to control the desired replica count for api7 deployment?

Use `replicaCount` item.

```sh
helm install api7-dashboard -n api7 --set replicaCount=N
```

### I don't like to install the prometheus servers, becuase I already have an existing one.

Disable the `promethues.builtin` and specify your existing Prometheus server addresses.

```sh
helm install api7-dashboard -n api7 \
	--set prometheus.builtin=false \
	--set prometheus.clusters={https://prometheus-0,https://prometheus-1,https://promtheus-2}
```

### Command for kind
Import api7-dashboard image:
```shell
kind load docker-image --nodes kind-control-plane --name kind api7-dashboard:2.8.2206
```

Expose service
```shell
kubectl port-forward service/api7-dashboard 9000:9000 -n api7
```
